# Welcome to the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)

The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) is an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/), fostering an open cybersecurity ecosystem, where products from all vendors and software publishers can freely exchange information, insights, analytics, and orchestrated response, via commonly developed code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, data standards, and procedures.

For more information about OCA, [visit our project website](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org.).

To learn more about how this Open Source project is governed, who our sponsors are, and who is serving on our Project Governing Board and Technical Steering Committee, check out the [OASIS Open Project repository](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oasis-open-project).
